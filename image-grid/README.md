# image-grid

Simple grid of images. Perfect for an online photo album !  
This example uses [fancybox](https://github.com/fancyapps/fancybox/) but it's not required.  
Just add a list.json file next to the index.html file with this structure :
```
[
    {
        image: "path/to/the/image",
        thumbnail: "path/to/the/thumbnail"
    },
    ...
]
```
With the default settings, thumbnails should be 300x300 px in size.
